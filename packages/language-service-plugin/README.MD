# Language Service Plugin

[Reference](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin)

To test this plugin out, compile the code and open the `example` folder in a VSCode instance:

```
code ./example
```

Also, please, make sure the workspace version of TypeScript is used. Use the `TypeScript: Select TypeScript version` command for this.
