original: "'yield' expression implicitly results in an 'any' type because its containing generator lacks a return-type annotation."
excerpt: "I don't know enough about your generator function's return type to safely infer here."

You can do one of two following options:

1. (_Recommended_) Either cast the `yield` value using `as`, or strictly declare the type of the variable

```ts
function* watchTasks() {
  const taskChannel: ActionChannelEffect = yield actionChannel([
    //no longer has to infer
    'task-submit',
    'task-remove',
  ]);
  //...
}
```

2. Specify the return type of your generator function for **all** contained `yield` steps

```ts
function* watchTasks(): Generator<ActionChannelEffect, void> {
  const taskChannel = yield actionChannel([
    //can now infer here safely
    'task-submit',
    'task-remove',
  ]);
  //...
}
```
