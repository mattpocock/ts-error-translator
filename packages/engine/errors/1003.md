original: 'Identifier expected.'
excerpt: 'I was expecting a name but none was provided.'

You are using a keyword that expects to be followed by a **variable, type, interface, class, function,** or **property** name but none was provided in the location were I'm pointing at.

The following examples are invalid:

```ts
function () {}
type Foo = (typeof);
Number.;
```

Providing a valid name (identifier) in the location where I'm pointing at fixes the issue:

```ts
function bar() {} // function name added after 'function'
type Foo = typeof bar; // variable name added after 'typeof'
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER; // property name added after '.'
```
