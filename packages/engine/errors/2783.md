I think you need to reorder the object property assignments and move the spread first. When spreading, what comes first is 'overridden' by what comes later. For example, if you have assignments like these:

```ts
const foo = {
  bar: 'A',
};

const baz = {
  bar: 'B',
  ...foo,
};
```

change it like this:

```ts
const baz = {
  ...foo,
  bar: 'B',
};
```
