original: "Conversion of type '{0}' to type '{1}' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first."
excerpt: "You can't use 'as' to convert '{0}' into a '{1}' - they don't share enough in common."

It looks like you're trying to use `as` to 'cast' one type into another. Your first type:

```
{0}
```

doesn't match up with

```
{1}
```

because there isn't what I call 'sufficient overlap' between them. I.e. they don't look enough like each other.

If you really meant to do this, you should cast `{0}` to `unknown` first. For example, if I wanted to cast `string` to `string[]`, I'd need to write this code:

```ts twoslash
const a = "wow" as unknown as string[];
```
