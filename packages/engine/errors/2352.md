original: "Conversion of type '{0}' to type '{1}' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first."
excerpt: "You can't use 'as' to convert '{0}' into a '{1}' - they don't share enough in common."

It looks like you're trying to use `as` to 'cast' one type into another. Your first type:

```
{0}
```

doesn't match up with

```
{1}
```

because there isn't what I call 'sufficient overlap' between them. I.e. they don't look enough like each other.

If you really meant to do this, you should cast `{0}` to `unknown` first. For example, if I wanted to cast `string` to `string[]`, I'd need to write this code:

```ts twoslash
const a = "wow" as unknown as string[];
```

However, casting a type to `unknown` only to cast it to another more specific type can be dangerous. You should only do this when you are certain that the type you are casting it to matches every possible value at runtime. You may also want to consider why you have to cast the type in the first place, could you improve some other type upstream and avoid casting it altogether?
