excerpt: "Your JSX elements have a type of 'any' because I can't find a type definition for JSX.{0}"

This error happens when I can't find a type definition for JSX.{0}. This is usually because you're using a JSX element without importing the type definition for it. Make sure all of your dependencies are installed and that you're importing the types you need.
