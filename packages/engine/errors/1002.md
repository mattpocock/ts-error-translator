original: 'Unterminated string literal.'
excerpt: "You've started a string (via a single or double quote) but haven't ended it."

To fix this error, check if:

- you have opening and closing quotes (single or double) for your string literal
- you have escaped your string literal correctly (by prefixing it with `/`)
- your string literal isn't split across multiple lines

### Examples

You can't split a string across multiple lines like this in JavaScript:

```js
const longString = 'This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.';
// ðŸ‘Ž
```

Instead, use template literals, which are supported in ECMAScript 2015 environments:

```js
const longString = `This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.`;
// âœ…
```
