You can assign variables types to give me hints about what kind of types you want to allow in that variable. For instance:

```ts
const num: number = 0;
```

This tells me that `num` will always be a `number`.

But sometimes, you'll break that pact you made with me. For instance:

```ts
const num: number = 'some string';
```

In your case, you said that this type was the only thing assignable to that variable:

```
{1}
```

And you passed me this instead:

```
{0}
```
