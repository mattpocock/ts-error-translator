original: "Class name cannot be '{0}'"
excerpt: "You can't give a class the name of '{0}' because it's protected by TypeScript."

Instead of naming your classes based on TypeScript types...

```ts
class {
  0;
}
{
}
```

...you should name your classes to something which is not a TypeScript type. Check out all the types in the docs on [Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html).
