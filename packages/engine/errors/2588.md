original: "Cannot assign to '{0}' because it is a constant."
excerpt: "You wanted 'A' to be a constant variable, but you tried reassigning another value to it."

If you want to be able to reassign a value to to this variable, you can make it a non-constant variable. For example:

```ts
const foo = 10; // Constant variable
foo = 25; // This should produce an error

let bar = 77; // Non-constant variable
bar = 56; // 'bar' is now 56.
```
