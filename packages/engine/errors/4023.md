I think you are not exporting something.
For example, you may have a component with an interface defined in the same file:

```ts
interface iButton {
  onPress: () => void;
  children?: string;
}

const IButton = ({
  onPress,
  ...props
}: iButton) => {
  return (
    <Button onPress={onPress}>
        {props?.children}
    </Button>
  );
};

export default IButton;
}
```

and then you are trying to access it, i.e. to style it.

```ts
import IButton from './IButton';
export const StyledIButton = styled(IButton)`
  justify-content: center;
`;
```

Unless you export the `iButton` interface, I do not know where to get it's shape.

```ts
export interface iButton {
  onPress: () => void;
  children?: string;
}
```
