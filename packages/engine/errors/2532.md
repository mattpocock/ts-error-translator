original: "Object is possibly 'undefined'."
excerpt: 'You have a property that may not hold an explicit value.'
---

In certain situations when calling a property from within an object -- whether or not it is a function -- you might not always know ahead of time if it will hold any value. Due to such unreliability you should use optional chaining to declare upfront if the property will hold a value or immediately return `undefined` to avoid throwing a nullish error. This way, you will not have to check each reference in the chain first to see if it is valid.

```ts
object?.property
```
