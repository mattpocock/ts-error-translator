original: 'A mapped type may not declare properties or methods.'
excerpt: "You're trying to create a mapped type with both static and dynamic properties."
---

```ts
type Keys = 'Foo' | 'Bar';
type MyMappedType = {
  Baz: string; // << static properties
  [Key in Keys]: string; // << dynamic properties
}; // ðŸ‘Ž
```

An interface can only have static properties. You cannot create a mapped type with an interface.

```ts
type Keys = 'Foo' | 'Bar';
interface MyInterface {
  [Key in Keys]: string;
} // ðŸ‘Ž
```
