original: "'const' declarations must be initialized."
excerpt: "A `const` must be given a value when it's declared."

I don't expect `const` variables to ever change after they're created. 
Therefore, I don't think it makes sense to create one without an initial value.

This confuses me:

```ts
const name: string;
```

But this is cool:

```ts
const name: string = "Jared";
```
