I expect objects to have unique property names.

Because this object has a duplicate property, I don't know how to deal with it:

```ts
const dish = {
  name: "Mom's spaghetti",
  chef: 'Eminem',
  delicious: false,
  delicious: true,
};
```

I'll be happy again if you remove the duplicate like so:

```ts
const dish = {
  name: "Mom's spaghetti",
  chef: 'Eminem',
  delicious: true,
};
```
