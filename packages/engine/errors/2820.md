Let's assume the following case:

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: Role;
}

type Role = 'admin' | 'user' | 'super-admin';

export const defaultUser: User = {
  id: 1,
  firstName: 'Matt',
  lastName: 'Pocock',
  role: 'admiiin', // "admiiin" does not exist in our Role Type so TS throws an error
};
```

Using the Union Type Operator we created a User interface that can only take one of the following roles: "admin", "user" or "super-admin".

In defaultUser declaration, we set "role" to "admiiin" which is not among the three roles set by the Role Type which is why Typescript throws us an error.
