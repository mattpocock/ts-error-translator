You need to narrow down the type of the variable before accessing its properties or assigning it to a different typed variable. For example:

```ts
const foo: unknown = 'bar';

if (typeof foo === 'string') {
  // Now I know 'foo' is of type 'string',
  const baz: string = foo; // I can assign it to a typed variable
  foo.toUpperCase(); // and access its properties
}
```
