excerpt: "You are trying to reference a function or variable which Typescript cannot find within the scope."

This means that you are trying to reference a variable or method which cannot be resolved within the same scope. It is most likely a typo. 

Double check that you have spelt it correctly. You even have a suggestion from me, letting you know if `{1}` might be what you're looking for.
