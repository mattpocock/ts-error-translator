original: "Value of type '{0}' is not callable. Did you mean to include 'new'?"
excerpt: "You are trying to call a value that cannot be called. Did you mean to add 'new'?"
---
Classes aren't callable by themselves, but need the 'new' keyword to create a new instance of them.
Example:
```ts
class Example {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Hello, world!")
  }
}

Example()
```
This throws an error because `Example` isn't callable.
However, adding `new` like this:
```ts
new Example()
```
is valid, and will log `Hello, world!` to the console.
