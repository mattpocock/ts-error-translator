original: "Types of property '{0}' are incompatible."
excerpt: "Two similar types have a property '{0}' which is different, making them incompatible."

You are assigning to a variable whose type `Foo` matches type `Bar` but they both have a property `{0}` whose type is incompatible with each other. For example:

```ts
interface Foo {
  {0}: string
}
interface Bar {
  {0}: number
}
const foo: Foo = { {0}: "" }
const bar: Bar = foo
```

Types `Foo` and `Bar` are structurally equal because they have the same properties. However, they are incompatible because the type of property `{0}` is `string` in `Foo` and `number` in `Bar`.
