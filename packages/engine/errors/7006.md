This is one of my most commonly-delivered errors! You've likely declared a function, for instance:

```ts
function myFunction({0}) {
  // Something in here...
}
```

But right now, I don't know what type `{0}` is supposed to be - so I've defaulted it to `{1}`.

The reason this is showing as an error is because you've got `"strict": true` in your TS Config.
