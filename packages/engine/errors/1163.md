original: "A 'yield' expression is only allowed in a generator body."
excerpt: "The `yield` keyword can only be used inside a generator function"

To use yield you should turn your function into a generator by adding an asterisk (*) next to the function name. For instance:

```ts
const squaredNum = function* (num: number) {
   yield num * num;
};
```
