original: "A 'yield' expression is only allowed in a generator body."
excerpt: 'The `yield` keyword can only be used inside a generator function'

To use yield you should turn your function into a generator by adding an asterisk (\*) next to the function name. For instance:

```ts
const squaredNum = function* (num: number) {
  yield num * num;
};
```
