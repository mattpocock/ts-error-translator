excerpt: "I've spotted a bit of code that will never be run."

Some of your code is stranded with no way of being executed.

For example:

```ts
function printAndReturn(text: string){
  return; 
  console.log(text);
}
```

This function will stop when it returns on the first line, so text will never be printed.
