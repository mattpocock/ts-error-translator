The most common place where such error occurs is when we pass prop as arguments to another function and then try to reference the propery via that argument. Now `name` has two sources of types and it becomes very easy to mess up in either of the place. 

```ts
interface Obj {
    name: string;
}

const {1}: Obj = {
    name: 'Typescript'
}

function getName(name: {0}): void {
    const objName = {1}[name]
}
```
